A C++ implementation of an in-memory, type-safe table data structure. Supports column-wise and row-wise stores of data and serialization. By parsing and executing the 'WHERE' part of a SQL 'SELECT' statement queries are enable. Depends on (a few) [boost libraries](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/). Comes with a set of unit tests. Build the source code on windows using [Visual C++ 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express).
